        <p>Dive gear doesn't always fit together how you want it too. Making your own is sometimes the only way to get the functionality you're looking for in your equipment. I figured I would offer other people the opprotunity to solve some of the same problems I have with my dive gear. If something looks useful to improve your own diving, message me on any of the apps below and I'll send you what you want. Just pay shipping and I will send you the items.
